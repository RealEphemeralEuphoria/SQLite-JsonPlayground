# Rnd3SQLite Project

In this project, we created test data and imported it into sqlite3. We added json objects and sliced them, identified architectural issues such as Software Engineering being a department all on its own while also being the only json-received employee data. I think as a result I can sort of explain data types, basic queries, some python tricks. 

Where I fell short is I wish I could have figured out how to stand up a pipeline to alter the json data to be aligned with the format of the other records as part of its move to staging. This is my second time trying to tackle that problem and haven't brought it to a close.
