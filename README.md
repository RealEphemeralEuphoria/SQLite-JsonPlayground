SQLite JSON Playground

This repository serves as a playground for my experimenting with SQLite's JSON functionality, specifically focusing on the json_each and json_extract functions. It is dynamic SQL workflows.

Features

Dynamic JSON Queries:
Extract specific fields using json_extract.
Break down JSON arrays into individual rows with json_each.

Parameterized Queries:
Select records by role or user ID without modifying multiple parts of the query.

Integration with CSV:
Export query results dynamically to CSV files.

Scalable JSON Data:
Work with datasets containing hundreds of nested JSON objects.

Reusable Scripts:
Modular Python and SQL scripts for testing.
